# datasift-client-tests
Central repository used to store the Gherkin tests implemented across all the DataSift client libraries

Note, each client library should recommend users use `git clone git@github.com:datasift/client-repo.git --recursive`. 
This will ensure users don't have to worry about the use of sub-modules.
